# Keyboard

There are many implications in using a different keyboard layout than
the by default QWERTY and its worldwide variants. 

The French AZERTY keyboard being an absurd design (typing È or Ç is impossible), the community ended up creating the [bepo](bepo.fr) layout.

# Optimo & Optima Keyboard Layouts

The Optimo layout is the same than the bepo with the following changes:
* Better availability of W and Z
* Direct access to ´ (dead acute), better access to \` (dead grave)
* Direct or improved access to developer’s characters: <, >, \_,
  no shift insecable space

## [Optimo](optimo): optimized layout for Orthogonal keyboards
## [Optima](optima): optimized layout with A fingers position, for staggered ISO keyboards

The bepo.fr branch is set to track https://git.tuxfamily.org/dvorak/pilotes.git
